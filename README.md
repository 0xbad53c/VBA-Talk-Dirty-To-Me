# VBA-Talk-Dirty-To-Me
Using the Windows SpVoice interface from VBA to speak to the user running your maldoc. Educational phishing just got more impactful! Example macro and .doc in the repo. I came across this while enumerating available COM objects and it was too funny not too share.


## ClickToWin.doc
This file is a simple Proof of Concept. Open the document, enable macros and click the button. Don't forget to turn on sound!

## Payload.vba
In case you don't trust the ClickToWin.doc, create your own macro-enabled word document and use this code to make it talk!
